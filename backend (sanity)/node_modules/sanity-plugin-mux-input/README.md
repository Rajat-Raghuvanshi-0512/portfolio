# Mux Video Input Sanity Plugin

> **NOTE**
>
> This is the **Sanity Studio v2 version** of sanity-plugin-mux-input.
>
> For the v3 version, please refer to the [main branch](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-mux-input).

This is a plugin that let you use [Mux](https://www.mux.com) video assets in your Sanity studio.

The Mux plugin for Sanity gives you a way to upload and preview videos easily.

[Read our blog post](https://www.sanity.io/blog/first-class-responsive-video-support-with-the-new-mux-plugin) about this plugin.

## Quick start

- While in your project folder, run `sanity install mux-input`.
  Read more about [using plugins in Sanity here](https://www.sanity.io/docs/plugins).

* Make a schema type that uses the plugin's type `mux.video`, for example:

  ```js
  {
    title: "Video blog post",
    name: "videoBlogPost",
    type: "document",
    fields: [
      { title: "Title", name: "title", type: "string" },
      {
        title: "Video file",
        name: "video",
        type: "mux.video"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Get an API Access Token and enter it into the setup screen
  First time you use the plugin you will be asked to enter your Mux credentials.

  The Mux Video API uses an Access Token and Secret Key for authentication.

  If you haven't already, generate a new Access Token in the Access Token settings of your Mux account dashboard, and make sure it got permission to both read and write _video_ and read _data_.

  The token is stored in the dataset as a document of the type `mux.apiKey` with the id `secrets.mux`.
  Having the ID be non-root ensures that only editors are able to see it.

  The Mux plugin will find its access tokens by fetching this document.

# Playing videos in the frontend

We recommend using [Mux Player](https://www.mux.com/player), try the [Codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-mux-input/tree/main/example).

# Enabling Signed Urls

To enable [signed urls](https://docs.mux.com/docs/security-signed-urls) with content uploaded to Mux, you will need to check the "Enable Signed Urls" option in the Mux Plugin configuration. Assuming that the API Access Token and Secret Key are set (as per the [Quick start](#quick-start) section).

More information for this feature of the plugin can be found on Mux's [documentation](https://docs.mux.com/docs/headless-cms-sanity#advanced-signed-urls)

# Enabling MP4 support

To enable [static MP4 renditions](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/enable-static-mp4-renditions), create or open the config file found in `config/mux-input.json` in your studio folder. This file is automatically created the first time the studio starts after adding the plugin.

```
{
  "mp4_support": "standard"
}
```

Currently, `mp4_support` is the only supported MUX option and this supports a value of either `standard` or `none` (the default).

# Contributing

Issues are actively monitored and PRs are welcome. When developing this plugin the easiest setup is:

1. Fork this repo.
1. Install the sanity cli and create a sanity project: `npm install -g @sanity/cli && sanity init`. Follow the prompts, starting out with the blog template is a good way to go.
1. `cd` into your project directory, run `npm install && npm start` - your sanity studio should be running on http://localhost:3333.
1. `cd` into the `plugins` directory of your project.
1. Fork this repo and clone your fork into the `plugins` directory inside your project `git clone git@github.com:your-fork/sanity-plugin-mux-input.git`.
1. Open `sanity.json`, go to the `plugins` array and add `mux-input`.
1. Re-start the sanity studio server with `npm start`.
1. Edit `schemas/post.js` and add follow the plugin documentation to add a `mux.video` type field.
1. Your studio should reload, and now when you edit the plugin code it should reload the studio, when you're done creating a branch, put in a PR and a maintainer will review it. Thank you!

# Publishing

Run the ["CI" workflow](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-mux-input/actions/workflows/ci.yml).
Make sure to select the studio-v2 branch and check "Release new version".

Semantic release will only release on configured branches, so it is safe to run release on any branch.

On the [studio-v2](/tree/studio-v2) branch this will result in:

- a new version on the `latest` dist-tag.
- running `yarn add sanity-plugin-mux-input` or `npm i sanity-plugin-mux-input` will fetch the new version.
- running `sanity install mux-input` will fetch the new version.
- studio-v3 users are unaffected.

On the [main](/tree/main) branch this will result in:

- a new prerelease version on the `studio-v3` dist-tag.
- running `yarn add sanity-plugin-mux-input@studio-v3` or `npm i sanity-plugin-mux-input@studio-v3` will fetch the new version.
- running `sanity install mux-input` won't fetch the new version.

After Studio v3 turns stable this behavior will change. The v2 version will then be available on the `studio-v2` dist-tag, and `studio-v3` is upgraded to live on `latest`.

# Test

`npm test`
